            <h2>About Me</h2><br>
            <p>Hi I’m Tristan O’Hanlon.</p>

            <p>I am a registered and practising senior Physics teacher in Auckland. I have been teaching in New Zealand schools for 10 years, specialising in all levels of NCEA and Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) Physics curricula as well as NZQA Scholarship Physics which many of my students have achieved.</p>

            <p>My pass rates are exceptional and I have had students go on to study Engineering, Physics and Medicine at universities such as Oxford, Stanford and Monash.</p>

            <p>I am on the organising committee of the NZ Young Physicists Tournament and coordinate the Auckland CERN Masterclass at the University of Auckland. I have also run overseas school Physics trips to Europe and the USA, visiting sites such as CERN and NASA.</p>

                <p>Physics can be a difficult subject for some and I am committed to helping each of my students achieve to the best of their ability and at the highest possible level.</p>
